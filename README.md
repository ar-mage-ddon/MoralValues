# MoralValues
MoralValues is a moral compass test inspired by SapplyValues. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a moral compass.
